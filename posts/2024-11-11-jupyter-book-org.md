Over the last ten months, the Jupyter Book team have been hard at work building the next major version of Jupyter Book (see [the blog post][plan]). During this time, a strong distinction between the tools developed for the legacy Sphinx application and its new [MyST Engine][mystmd]-powered sibling has arisen, leading to the submission of a [Jupyter Enhancement Proposal to incorporate Jupyter Book][book-jep] as a Jupyter Subproject.

Under the Jupyter organisation, the Jupyter Book team hopes to have found a
> longer-lasting and organizationally-neutral home for the vision, strategy, tools, and standards of this modern version of the Jupyter Book toolchain.
> -- Jupyter Enhancement Proposal #122
